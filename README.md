This is a project containing example codes in NASM

The following examples are available right now (ordered by complexity (as I feel it)):

| Name                               | Description                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| [exit_0.asm](exit_0.asm)           | Exits with the 0 error code                  |
| [add.asm](add.asm)                 | Adds 2 values and exits with that error code |
| [hello_world.asm](hello_world.asm) | Good old Hello World                         |
